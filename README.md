This is the homework.

Some testing

I am creating conflict here

~~Anyway, re: the homework, I see what absolute positioning did to my prargraph, let's not do that, k?  Go look at the cupcake.~~

Retooling the cupcake page, I made it nice and responsive ... and then I tried to follow the instructions.  I think I got the basics down ~~don't hurt me plz.~~
